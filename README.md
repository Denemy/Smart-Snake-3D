### About the project üêç

My first mobile game. I created smart snakes that live in 3D aquarium.
Their task to eat as much food as possible, who ate more and did not die the winner.
Smart they are because they know how to calculate where the nearest food is located
and choose the best path to her bypassing all obstacles.
I also added pretty cute soundtrack and animation of food eating.
In the game settings, you can select the number of snakes and their speed,
turn off or turn on the sound.
You can solve the dispute or just play with friends to bet on the snake;)
